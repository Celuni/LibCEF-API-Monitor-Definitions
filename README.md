# LibCEF.xml

This is a set of custom [API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) definitions for the [Chrome Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) shared library.

You can use them by placing the `.xml` file in the `APIMonitor\API\CEF\` directory of your API Monitor install.

This does not cover all functions or types, on the ones I've needed in my research.
